I have been at [Reurse Center](https://www.recurse.com) for several weeks now. I'm happy to say that I have mostly achieved my aims for my time here.

* Learn Rust
* Ship a Rust project
* Commit to an open source Rust project

Learn Rust:  I spent the first few weeks writing LISP interpreters, and while I don't think anyone can ever truly know a language. I certainly feel that I have the essentials down and find myself agreeing with the borrow checker more often than fighting it.

Ship a Rust project: Yep, I made [SQL Window Functions](https://www.windowfunctions.com) after a conversation with a colleague where I realised I didn't know window functions well.

Commit to open source Rust: Yes I've made a fix to [Rust Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rust-clippy) and [Tera](https://github.com/Keats/tera). I'll do some more while I am here.

I've also revamped my website as a reboot was overdue and included this blog!
